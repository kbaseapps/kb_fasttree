# kb_fasttree

## Contributing

This is a [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).

You will need to have the KBase SDK installed to use this module if you want to make any changes to the spec or the API. However, other development work does not require the SDK and can be done locally.

[Learn more about the SDK and how to use it](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/).

## API changes

If you make changes to the spec (and thus the API) of the kb_fasttree app, you will need to recompile the app to generate updated versions of `kb_fasttreeImpl.py`, `kb_fasttreeServer.py`, etc., and the compilation report, `compile_report.json`. These updated files must be committed to the GitHub repo.

Use the command `make compile` (or simply `make`) to regenerate these files.
